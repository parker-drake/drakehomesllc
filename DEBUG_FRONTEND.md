# Debug Steps - Please follow these:

## 1. Open Browser Developer Tools
- Right-click on the page → Inspect
- Go to the **Network** tab
- Filter by "Img" or images
- Refresh the page

## 2. Check for Image Requests
Look for any image requests that are:
- **Red** (failed)
- **404** (not found)
- **403** (forbidden)

## 3. Check Console for Errors
- Go to the **Console** tab
- Look for any errors related to images, especially:
  - "Invalid src prop"
  - "hostname not configured"
  - Any Next.js Image errors

## 4. Check API Response
- In Network tab, find the `/api/properties` request
- Click on it → Response tab
- Check if the `image` field has actual URLs or is null

## 5. Test One Image URL Directly
- Copy one of the image URLs from the API response
- Paste it directly in a new browser tab
- See if the image loads

Let me know what you find!
